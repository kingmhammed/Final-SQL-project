--For the final project I’ve decided to work on a dataset called CHINOOK, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
--The employees table stores employee data such as employee id, last name, first name, etc. It also has a field named ReportsTo to specify who reports to whom.
--The customer table stores customer data. The line between employees.Employeeid and customers.SupportRepID shows how the two tables are related (ie, how you would JOIN them).
--The invoices table stores invoice header data (Customer ID, Billing Address, etc) and the invoice_items table stores the invoice line items data (Unit Price, Quantity).
--The artists table stores artists' data.
--Albums table stores data about a list of tracks. Each album belongs to one artist. However, one artist –may have multiple albums.
--Media_types table stores media types such as MPEG audio and AAC audio files.
--Genres table stores music types such as rock, jazz, metal, etc.
--Tracks table stores the data of songs. Each track belongs to one album.
--Playlists table store data about playlists. Each playlist contains a list of tracks. Each track may belong to multiple playlists. 
--The relationship between the playlists table and tracks table is many-to-many. The playlist_track table is used to reflect this relationship.



--1.Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
--(Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country != "USA";


--2. Show only the Customers from Brazil

SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers cust
WHERE country = 'Brazil';


--3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
--The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing count

SELECT cust.FirstName, Cust.LastName, 
inv.InvoiceID, inv.invoiceDate, inv.billingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices AS inv
LEFT JOIN chinook. customers AS cust
ON inv.customerId= cust.customerId
WHERE inv.billingCountry= 'Brazil';


--4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT * 
FROM chinook.Employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";


--5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT distinct inv.billingcountry 
FROM chinook.invoices AS inv;


--6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
--The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT emp.Firstname, emp.LastName, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;


--7. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT *
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


--8. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices
 WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


--9. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.Name, inv.InvoicelineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items inv
JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON inv.trackId= t.trackId;


--10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND 
--artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT ar.name as Artist, t.Name as Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON ar.ArtistID=a.ArtistID;


--11. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;
